# Creative Notes: Structured Canvas - Design Document

## Vision
A sophisticated note-taking application that marries Notion's structural elegance with the spontaneity of creative thinking. The app will embody a "structured canvas" metaphor, allowing thoughts to be simultaneously organized and free-flowing, with a tactile quality that makes digital note-taking feel substantial and gratifying.

## Core Features

   - Rich text editing with markdown support
   - Specialized creative blocks (concept maps, mood boards, freeform sketches)
   - Seamless block transformations (text ↔ table ↔ chart)
   - Drag-and-drop reordering

2. **Structural Organization**
   - Hierarchical outline view in a sliding panel
   - Collapsible sections
   - Focus mode for isolated section editing
   - Smart linking between notes with visual relationship maps

3. **Customizable Views**
   - Gallery/list view for collections
   - Transform content between document, kanban, and mind map views
   - Template gallery with structured creative frameworks

4. **Fluid UI Experience**
   - Contextual toolbars appearing on hover/selection
   - Fluid animations for spatial context
   - Progressive disclosure of advanced features
